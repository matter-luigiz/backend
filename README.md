# matter backend

For information about the Matter project as a whole, see [our organization README](https://github.com/matter-luigiz).

For the hosted version of the site, go to [luigiz-matter.tech](https://luigiz-matter.tech).

Our backend is an Express server built using Javascript. This repository contains the code for this server as well as
our webscraping scripts for obtaining product listings, which are written using Python, and our JSON files that store
the scraped product listings.

To run the server for development, simply clone the repository and run npm install followed by npm start.
The listening port can be changed in the .env file.
